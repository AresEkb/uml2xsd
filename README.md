UML to XML Schema 1.1
=======

Here is a transformation from UML model into XML Schema 1.1.
OCL constraints are transformed into XPath-expressions.

The project is dependent on a XPath 2.0 (https://github.com/AresEkb/EMFTextXPath2) and XSD 1.1, XSLT 2.0 (https://github.com/AresEkb/xmodel) metamodels.

A more complete description is needed.
